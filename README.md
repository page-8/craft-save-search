#Save Search#

##Description##
Save Search is a _dead simple_ [CraftCMS](http://www.buildwithcraft.com) plugin developed by [Page 8](http://page-8.com). It allows your last search to be saved and populated in the search box's in Craft. This is useful when navigating away from a listings page and wanting to retain your search when you return.

##Installation##
1. Download the plugin and make sure the parent folder is named `savesearch`
2. Move the folder into your `craft/plugins` directory
3. Install the plugin under **Craft Admin &rsaquo; Settings &rsaquo; Plugins**

##Usage##
After enabling continue to use Craft as normal. Your last search for an area of the CMS will automatically popualate in that search box. This is useful in browsers like Chrome where it won't retain your search when you go back. So, if you've filtered a list (title::A*), that query will be saved and your results will remain filtered.

This is way too long of an explanation for something so ridiculously simple. There's more lines in this README than there is code.

##Requirements##
It got broke for version 2.3, so I'm not acutally positive if it works for a version before this.
